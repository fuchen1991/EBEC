EBEC is Java library for checking language equivalence of NFA(nondeterministic finite automata). It implements following algorithms:
- HK algorithm
- HK algorithm augmented with memoisation
- symbolic HK algorithm
- HKC algorithm
- HKC algorithm augmented with memoisation
- symbolic HKC algorithm
- antichain algorithm
- antichain algorithm augmented with memoisation
And all the algorithms above can be optimized with preprocessing operations (similarity or bisimilarity).
